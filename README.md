# Leetcode challenges
Leetcode's algorithmic challenges that I use for DSA practice. Each question will typically include:
- URL to the problem on Leetcode 
- My solution 
- A better, more optimized solution
- Explanation on why the code is written this way, in inline comments, and periodically discuss more on the peformance (time and space complexities) in block comments
- Driver to test run the solution

This code is written in Python 3.  

## Run
1. Run on Leetcode: Follow the URL to the problem on Leetcode, set the langauge to Python3, copy and paste a solution in (ensure class name is "Solution") and click the Run/Submit button, or 
2. Run locally: Change the inputs (usually stated at the start of the driver code) and test run a solution with a Python intepreter
